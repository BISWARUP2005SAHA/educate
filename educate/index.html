            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">It sounds like you’re touching on a pretty significant debate about the relevance of traditional education in today’s world.
                 There are definitely arguments on both sides. On one hand, traditional education often emphasizes rote learning and standardized testing, which some argue doesn’t prepare students for the rapidly changing job market or foster critical thinking and creativity.
                 On the other hand, foundational knowledge in subjects like math, science, and literature can provide a strong base for understanding more complex ideas and problem-solving skills.</p>
